## Quick Example

```php
// From this messy API response...
$apiResponse = [
    'data' => [
        'departments' => [
            ['users' => [['email' => 'alice@example.com'], ['email' => 'bob@example.com']]],
            ['users' => [['email' => 'charlie@example.com']]],
        ],
    ],
];

// ...to this clean result in one line
$accessor = new DataAccessor($apiResponse);
$emails = $accessor->get('data.departments.*.users.*.email');
// Result: ['alice@example.com', 'bob@example.com', 'charlie@example.com']
```
